Made with ðŸ’Œ by D/S &copy; 2019 for charlin.be (Technical Test).

**Disclousure:** This project was bootstrapped with [react-native-cli](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to get things up and running fast, but all additional code was done by me.

At the moment just building for iOS and not Android
